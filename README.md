# SQL-content-management-systems

## Description
A database using Oracle's SQL to manage all your department, roles and employee information! For this project I primarily used SQL, SQLite, SQL2 and javascript to create a functioning program you can run in the terminal. 

## Installation
To install, your going to need to make sure you have inquirer, dotenv, and mysql2 in the package.json. To ensure the program works, I recommend running it on the versions below and checking if its the same under the dependencies in the package file: 
"console.table": "^0.10.0",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "inquirer": "^8.2.4",
    "mysql2": "^3.2.3".
    
 With the packages dealt with, we can now focus on getting SQL installed. Best refer to Oracle's documentation [Here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E39885_01/doc.40/e38928/install.htm#RPTIG122 "here:")
